"""The `Choice` transition-graph arc exposes its `a_node` as an AST wrapper.

`TransitionGraphArc::Choice` carries a `std::sync::Arc<fpp_ast::TransitionExpr>`
`a_node`. `TransitionExpr` is a real recorded walk node, so the binding surfaces
it as `astdef(TransitionExpr)` — a downcast to the `crate::ast::TransitionExpr`
wrapper. This test navigates to a Choice arc and confirms `a_node` downcast
cleanly (did not raise, and did not fall back to the opaque base).
